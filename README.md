## 📋 System Requirements

### Required Software
- **Python 3.7+**
- **ADB (Android Debug Bridge)**
- **Huawei/Honor Phone** (using Huawei Notepad app)

### Tested Devices
- Huawei budget model (circa 2020, Android version unknown)

*Theoretically supports all devices using the Huawei Notepad app*

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Python

#### Windows:
1. Visit [Python Official Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download the latest Python 3.x
3. **Important**: Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
4. Verify installation: Open Command Prompt and type `python --version`

#### macOS:
```bash
# Install using Homebrew
brew install python3

# Verify installation
python3 --version
```

#### Linux:
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip

# Verify installation
python3 --version
```

### 2. Install ADB

#### Windows:
This repository includes `platform-tools-latest-windows.zip`. Extract it in the repository root first; this should create a `platform-tools` folder.

Or download the latest version from [Google Official](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools).

#### macOS:
```bash
brew install android-platform-tools
```

#### Linux:
```bash
sudo apt install android-tools-adb
```

Verify installation:
```bash
adb version
```

### 3. Phone Setup

1. **Enable Developer Options**:
   - Go to Settings → About Phone
   - Tap "Build Number" 7 times
   - Return to Settings and find "Developer Options"

2. **Enable USB Debugging**:
   - Enter Developer Options
   - Enable "USB Debugging"
   - Authorize "Allow USB debugging" on your phone when connected to computer

3. **Verify Connection**:
   ```bash
   adb devices
   ```
   You should see your device listed

### 4. Run the Script

1. **Download this repository**:
   ```bash
   # Download/clone this repository, then enter its root directory
   cd huawei-notepad-extractor
   ```

2. **Windows only: extract bundled ADB** (if ADB is not already in `PATH`):
   - Extract `platform-tools-latest-windows.zip` into the repository root.
   - Stay in the repository root; the script automatically locates `platform-tools/adb.exe`.

3. **Open Huawei Notepad app**, navigate to the folder you want to extract (e.g., "Dream Records")

4. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python auto_extract_notes_ultimate.py
   ```

5. **Select mode**:
   ```
   Mode selection:
     1. Full auto mode - Extract from top to bottom (Recommended)
     2. Last screen mode - Extract current screen only
     3. With screenshots mode - Extract text + save screenshots
   Choose mode (1/2/3): 
   ```

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Mode 1: Full Auto (Recommended)
- **Use case**: Extract all notes from an entire folder
- **Steps**:
  1. Manually scroll to the **top** of the notepad list
  2. Select mode 1 and press Enter
  3. Script automatically extracts until the last entry
- **Output**: `FolderName.txt`
- Existing exports are never overwritten; the script adds `_1`, `_2`, etc. when needed.

### Mode 2: Last Screen
- **Use case**: Fill in missing entries, extract the last few notes
- **Steps**:
  1. Manually scroll to the **bottom** of the notepad list
  2. Select mode 2 and press Enter
  3. Script extracts 5 entries from current screen
- **Output**: `FolderName.txt`
- This mode writes a separate export and does not overwrite a previous full export.

### Mode 3: With Screenshots
- **Use case**: Notes with handwriting/images
- **Steps**:
  1. Enter folder containing handwritten notes
  2. Manually scroll to the **top** of the list
  3. Select mode 3 and press Enter
  4. Script extracts text + screenshots
- **Output**:
  - `FolderName.txt` - Text content
  - `FolderName_screenshots/` - Screenshot folder

### Output File Example

```
==================================================
Note #1 - Dream Records - December 27 03:14
==================================================
Today I dreamed of a very strange scene...
(Note content)

[📸 Screenshot: Dream_Records_screenshots/note_0001.png]  (if mode 3)
```

## 🔧 Coordinate Adjustment (If Click Position is Inaccurate)

Due to different **screen resolutions** on different devices, click coordinates may need adjustment.

### Symptoms
- Script clicks in wrong position during execution
- Doesn't open note detail page
- Clicks other locations

### Solution

#### Method 1: Measure Coordinates Using Online Tools
1. **Screenshot current screen**:
   ```bash
   adb shell screencap -p /sdcard/screen.png
   adb pull /sdcard/screen.png .
   ```

2. **Use these tools to measure coordinates** (choose one):
   - [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/) - Free online Photoshop, shows coordinates when mouse moves
   - [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) - Free open-source image editor
   - [Paint.NET](https://www.getpaint.net/) - Free Windows tool
   - [Pixlr](https://pixlr.com/) - Online image editor
   - Windows built-in **Paint**: Open image, coordinates shown in bottom left when mouse moves

3. **Measure center coordinates of**:
   - Center point of first note (usually upper 1/4 of list)
   - Center points of 5 notes on last screen (from top to bottom)

4. **Modify script**:
   - Open `auto_extract_notes_ultimate.py`
   - Search for `tap(350, 560)` 
   - Replace with your measured coordinates `tap(your_x, your_y)`
   - Search for `POSITIONS = [640, 880, 1140, 1395, 1654]`
   - Replace with your measured 5 y-coordinates

#### Method 2: View Real-time Coordinates Using ADB
```bash
# Enable pointer location display
adb shell settings put system pointer_location 1

# Tap on phone and observe coordinates at top of screen
# Record coordinates of first note

# Disable pointer location
adb shell settings put system pointer_location 0
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Before Use
- ✅ Ensure phone has sufficient battery (avoid interruption)
- ✅ Disable auto screen lock (Settings → Display → Sleep → Never)
- ✅ Keep USB connection stable
- ✅ Test on small amount of data first

### During Use
- ⚠️ **Do not touch phone screen** (interferes with script)
- ⚠️ **Do not disconnect USB**
- ⚠️ If interruption needed, close command line window directly
- ⚠️ Script pauses for 3 seconds every 30 clicks (normal behavior)

### Special Cases
- 📝 **Pure handwritten notes**: Content is empty but screenshot is saved (mode 3)
- 📝 **Bottom detection**: Stops after the visible list fails to move for 3 consecutive swipes
- 📝 **Timestamp**: Automatically extracts creation/modification time
- 📝 **Folder name**: Automatically recognizes Huawei notepad folder name as output filename

### Known Limitations
- ❌ Does not support voice memos
- ❌ Screenshots only capture first screen (long content requires manual scrolling)
- ❌ Images/handwriting can only be screenshotted, original images cannot be extracted
- ❌ Does not support notepad apps from other brands (OPPO, Xiaomi, etc.)

## 🐛 FAQ

### Q: Error "adb is not recognized as an internal or external command"
**A:** ADB not properly installed or not in PATH
- Windows: Extract the bundled ZIP in the repository root; the script will locate `platform-tools/adb.exe` automatically
- Or add the platform-tools folder to the system `PATH`

### Q: Error "no devices/emulators found"
**A:** Phone not properly connected
1. Check if USB cable is connected
2. Check if USB debugging is authorized on phone
3. Run `adb devices` to view device list

### Q: Script clicks wrong position
**A:** Coordinates need adjustment, see "Coordinate Adjustment" section

### Q: Extracted content is empty
**A:** Possible reasons:
1. Note itself is pure handwriting (use mode 3)
2. UI structure changed (Huawei updated app)
3. Click position wrong, didn't enter detail page

### Q: Can I extract multiple folders?
**A:** Need to manually switch folders, extract one folder at a time

### Q: Will the script delete my notes?
**A:** **No!** Script only reads data, does not modify/delete anything

### Q: How long to extract 1000+ notes?
**A:** 
- Duration depends on the phone and ADB speed. UI verification adds safety but may make large exports take longer.
- Mode 3 takes longer because every note also requires a screenshot transfer.
